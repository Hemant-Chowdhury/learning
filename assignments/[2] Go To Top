## Go To Top

- There are n steps in a staircase. 
- You are currently at 0th step.
- You need to reach the nth step in the staircase. 
- You can only move upwards. 
- At a time you can take a jump of 5 or 7 steps. 
- You need to determine whether you can reach the top or not.

```
For example,
n=3, false 
n=5, true 
```
You need to output "true" or "false" for any n < 1000000

Go To Top
<p>
There are n steps in a staircase. <br>
You are currently at 0th step. <br>
You need to reach the nth step in the staircase. <br>
You can only move upwards. <br>
At a time you can take a jump of 5 or 7 steps. <br>
You need to determine whether you can reach the top or not.<br>

For example,<br>
n=3, false <br>
n=5, true <br>

You need to output "true" or "false" for any n < 1000000
